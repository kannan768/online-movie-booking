FCFS (FIRST COME FIRST SERVE):
⮚ In this scheduling algorithm, a person
is served according to the queue manner.
⮚ The person who arrives first in the
queue first buys the ticket and then the next
one.
⮚ This will continue until the last person in the
queue purchases the ticket.
⮚ Using this algorithm, the CPU process works in a
similar manner.
SEMAPHORES:
⮚ In computer science, a semaphore is a variable
or abstract data type used to control access to a
common resource by multiple processes in
concurrent system such as a
multitasking operating system.⮚ A semaphore is simply a variable.
⮚ If two persons want to access the system at the
time , deadlock will occur.
⮚ To overcome , this situation semaphores are
used.
⮚ In this mini project , deadlocks are handled by
semaphores
PRIORITY:
⮚ Priority scheduling is a non-preemptive
algorithm and one of the most
common scheduling algorithms in batch
systems.
⮚ Each process is assigned a priority. Process with
highest priority is to be executed first and so on.⮚ Processes with same priority are executed
on first come first served basis.
⮚ In this project, if user wants to access the page ,
admin have to finish his work.
⮚ So admin gets the priority first
